## BeatTripper

Imagine for a moment, you're walking to class, listening to your favorite songs.

Upon arrival, you think to yourself *"Hmm. That was about a 3 or 4 song walk."*

It's not a scientific measurement, but everyone thinks it at some point.

That's why we wrote BeatTripper, to help you track that metric.

Just tell BeatTripper where you're going and BeatTripper queues up a playlist of your favorite songs for you, on the spot.

When you arrive, hit the green check mark and your information is saved and used for statistical analysis to better help you estimate your potential for songs.
